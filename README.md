# Lunar & Planetary Phase Simulator

A lightweight, browser-based tool for visualizing lunar and planetary illumination phases and reflected-light phase curves.  
Built as a single-page application with zero external dependencies.

## Features

- **Interactive Disk Renderer**  Real-time visualization of illumination phase using Lambertian reflection.
- **Lunar Mode**  Date-linked synodic phase calculation with bright-limb position angle (PA) derived from approximate RA/Dec.
- **Planetary & Exoplanet Modes**  Adjustable inclination, eccentricity, argument of periastron, albedo, and radius-to-orbit ratio \((R_p/a)\).
- **Live Phase Curve**  Displays normalized reflected flux vs phase angle.
- **Exoplanet Presets**  Includes well-known systems like HD 209458 b, 51 Peg b, Kepler-10 b, WASP-12 b, and others.
- **Exports**  Save rendered disks as PNG and export simulated phase curves as CSV.
